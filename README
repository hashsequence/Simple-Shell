SIMPLE-SHELL 
---------------------------------------------
example execution:

simpsh \
  --rdonly a \
  --pipe \
  --pipe \
  --creat --trunc --wronly c \
  --creat --append --wronly d \
  --command 3 5 6 tr A-Z a-z \
  --command 0 2 6 sort \
  --wait

This example invocation creates seven file descriptors:

0 A read only descriptor for the file a, created by the --rdonly option.
1 The read end of the first pipe, created by the first --pipe option.
2 The write end of the first pipe, also created by the first --pipe option.
3 The read end of the second pipe, created by the second --pipe option.
4 The write end of the second pipe, also created by the second --pipe option.
5 A write only descriptor for the file c, created by the first --wronly option as modified by the preceding --creat and --trunc.
6 A write only, append only descriptor for the file d, created by the --wronly option as modified by the preceding --creat and --append options.
7 It then creates three subprocesses:

A subprocess with standard input, output, and error being the file descriptors numbered 3, 5, and 6 above. This subprocess runs the command tr with the two arguments A-Z and a-z.
A subprocess with standard input, standard output, and standard error being the file descriptors numbered 0, 2, and 6 above, respectively. This subprocess runs the command sort with no arguments
A subprocess with standard input, output, and error being the file descriptors numbered 1, 4, and 6 above. This subprocess runs the command cat with the two arguments b and -.
It then waits for all three subprocesses to finish. As each finishes, it prints its exit status, followed by the command and arguments. The output might look like this:

0 sort
0 cat b -
0 tr A-Z a-z


OPTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------

--append
O_APPEND
--cloexec
O_CLOEXEC
--creat
O_CREAT
--directory
O_DIRECTORY
--dsync
O_DSYNC
--excl
O_EXCL
--nofollow
O_NOFOLLOW
--nonblock
O_NONBLOCK
--rsync
O_RSYNC
--sync
O_SYNC
--trunc
O_TRUNC
Second are the file-opening options. These flags open files. Each file-opening option also corresponds to an oflag value, listed after the option. Each opened file is given a file number; file numbers start at 0 and increment after each file-opening option. Normally they increment by 1, but the --pipe option causes them to increment by 2.

--rdonly f
O_RDONLY. Open the file f for reading only.
--rdwr f
O_RDWR. Open the file f for reading and writing.
--wronly f
O_WRONLY. Open the file f for writing only.
--pipe
Open a pipe. Unlike the other file options, this option does not take an argument. Also, it consumes two file numbers, not just one.
Third is the subcommand options:

--command i o e cmd args
Execute a command with standard input i, standard output o and standard error e; these values should correspond to earlier file or pipe options. The executable for the command is cmd and it has zero or more arguments args. None of the cmd and args operands begin with the two characters "--".
--wait
Wait for all commands to finish. As each finishes, output its exit status, and a copy of the command (with spaces separating arguments) to standard output.
Finally, there are some miscellaneous options:

--close N
Close the Nth file that was opened by a file-opening option. For a pipe, this closes just one end of the pipe. Once file N is closed, it is an error to access it, just as it is an error to access any file number that has never been opened. File numbers are not reused by later file-opening options.
--verbose
Just before executing an option, output a line to standard output containing the option. If the option has operands, list them separated by spaces. Ensure that the line is actually output, and is not merely sitting in a buffer somewhere.
--profile
Just after executing an option, output a line to standard output containing the resources used. Use getrusage and output a line containing as much useful information as you can glean from it.
--abort
Crash the shell. The shell itself should immediately dump core, via a segmentation violation.
--catch N
Catch signal N, where N is a decimal integer, with a handler that outputs the diagnostic N caught to stderr, and exits with status N. This exits the entire shell. N uses the same numbering as your system; for example, on GNU/Linux, a segmentation violation is signal 11.
--ignore N
Ignore signal N.
--default N
Use the default behavior for signal N.
--pause
Pause, waiting for a signal to arrive.
